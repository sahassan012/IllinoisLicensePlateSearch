# IllinoisLicensePlateSearch
## About
This program implements an underlying Hashtable data structure with a hash function to yield O(1) retrieval of total fines associated with a given specialized Illinois License plate. User is prompted to enter a hash table size which the hashing algorithm uses to build the hash table. The user also enters a .txt filename parse through data (license plates and each fine).
